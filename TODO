this is the event source. important because and event should always pass it's source

> update the readme (oneTimeEvent, called on next tick after first)

Add a note to the readme for what will happen if you eventify a prototype: you get a class-like event where there is ONE listener collection emitting results in all listeners to all objects being called. Probably not useful behaviour.

observer pattern

how it is used in hotleads to make the code de coupled and simple

-> load eventify into the documentation page so that with the console, documentation can be interactive.
-> microjs for inspiration
-> documenting usage: there are many ways to bind/unbind. document ONE api and prefix the rest of the functions with a '_' ???
-> doc: tagged errors
-> doc: EventSubscription EventListener and Event are NOT intended for instantiation outside of this library
